    "text": "Overview\nThis session introduces students to the foundational concepts of Information Systems (IS) management. It provides an overview of the course structure, assessment criteria, and the importance of IS in organizations. The session also explores real-world applications and challenges associated with IS management.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the course structure and assessment methods: Students will be introduced to the overall layout of the course, including key topics and evaluation methods, such as projects, assignments, and presentations.\nDefine Information Systems and their role in businesses: This section covers the fundamental definition of IS, explaining how these systems collect, process, store, and distribute information within an organization.\nIdentify key challenges in IS management: Students will explore the most pressing issues faced by businesses when managing their IS, such as cybersecurity threats, technology integration, and aligning IS with business goals.\nAnalyze how IS supports business strategy using real-world examples: By examining case studies like Amazon and Equifax, students will learn how IS contributes to strategic business decisions and competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nCourse Overview & Expectations\n\nInstructor Introduction: The session begins with a brief introduction to the instructor’s background, expertise, and relevance of IS management in today’s business world.\nCourse Structure: The course consists of 15 structured sessions covering IS strategy, governance, ethics, emerging trends, and practical applications. Each session is designed to balance theoretical learning with case studies and hands-on activities.\nAssessment Breakdown:\n\nGroup Project (40%) – A team-based analysis of a real-world organization’s IS strategy and its alignment with business objectives.\nWritten Assignments (30%) – Individual essays exploring IT ethics, IS governance, and management case studies.\nIndividual Tasks (30%) – Students will deliver presentations and reports on selected readings and trends in IS.\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts in Information Systems\n\nWhat is an Information System?\nAn Information System (IS) is a structured framework that consists of technology, people, and processes designed to collect, manage, and analyze data for decision-making. IS plays a crucial role in various business functions, from operational efficiency to strategic planning.\n\n\nTypes of IS:\n\nTransaction Processing Systems (TPS): Used for routine business transactions, such as payroll processing and order management.\nManagement Information Systems (MIS): Designed to help middle managers make informed decisions using structured data.\nDecision Support Systems (DSS): Provides analytical tools and models to assist in complex decision-making.\nEnterprise Systems (ERP, SCM, CRM): Integrated platforms that connect different departments within a business for seamless information flow and process optimization.\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Amazon’s Use of IS\nAmazon utilizes sophisticated IS to maintain its dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing: - Inventory Management: AI-powered forecasting models predict demand and optimize stock levels to ensure efficient supply chain operations. - Customer Personalization: Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze customer behavior to offer personalized recommendations. - Cloud Computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides scalable computing power and cloud-based solutions for businesses worldwide, making it a key player in IS-driven business transformation.\n\n\nChallenges in IS Management\n\nKeeping up with rapid technological changes: Organizations must constantly adapt to emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and cloud computing to remain competitive.\nCybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns: With increasing cyber threats, companies must invest in robust security measures to protect sensitive data and comply with regulations like GDPR.\nAligning IS with business objectives: Ensuring that IS investments support the overall business strategy is crucial for maximizing value.\nManaging resistance to new IS implementations: Employees often resist changes to technology due to lack of training or fear of job displacement.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Equifax Data Breach\nEquifax, a major credit reporting agency, suffered a catastrophic data breach in 2017, exposing personal data of 147 million people. The failure was attributed to poor IS security management, including outdated systems and delayed software patches. This case highlights the critical need for cybersecurity governance and proactive risk management in IS.\n\n\nClass Activities\n\nIcebreaker: Students discuss their expectations for the course and share personal experiences related to IS.\nIdentify IS in Everyday Life: Students list and analyze various IS they use daily, such as online banking, Netflix, or cloud storage, and discuss how these systems enhance decision-making.\nGroup Discussion: Teams debate the most pressing IS challenges today and propose possible solutions.\nMini Case Study: Analyzing the Equifax Data Breach, students identify key IS failures and lessons learned.\n\n\n\nHomework for Next Session\n\nReading: “Strategic alignment: A model for organizational transformation through IT” – Henderson & Venkatraman (1992).\nPreparation: Each student prepares a 2-minute summary explaining how IS strategy aligns with business objectives, to be discussed in the next session.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nStrategic Alignment Model (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1992) – A foundational framework explaining how IS supports business strategy.\nHow Amazon Uses IS for Competitive Advantage – Insights into Amazon’s data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.\nEquifax Data Breach Case Study – A detailed breakdown of the breach, its causes, and preventative measures for organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
