### **Lecture Structure:**  

#### **1. What is Information System (IS) Integration? (20 minutes)**  
- **Definition:** IS integration refers to connecting different software applications and databases to function as a unified system.  
- **Importance:**  
  - Streamlines business processes  
  - Enhances data visibility and accuracy  
  - Supports real-time decision-making  

- **Types of Integration:**  
  - **Data Integration:** Centralizing data for consistent access  
  - **Application Integration:** Linking systems for smooth process execution  
  - **Process Integration:** Automating workflows across departments  

- **Examples:**  
  - Integration between CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP  
  - E-commerce platform integration with supply chain systems  

---

#### **2. Challenges of IS Integration (15 minutes)**  
- **Technical Challenges:**  
  - Legacy systems incompatibility  
  - Data migration issues  
  - Maintaining data integrity and security  

- **Organizational Challenges:**  
  - Resistance to change from employees  
  - High implementation and maintenance costs  
  - Coordination between departments  

- **Case Study:**  
  - Analyze a failed or complex integration (e.g., Hersheyâ€™s failed ERP implementation in the late 1990s, which led to supply chain disruptions).

#### **3. What is an ERP System? (15 minutes)**  
- **Definition:**  
  An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system is an integrated software platform that manages core business processes in real time through a centralized database.  

- **Core Characteristics of ERPs:**  
  - Unified data model  
  - Real-time data updates  
  - Modular architecture  

- **Functional Modules in ERP:**  
  - **Finance and Accounting:** Budgeting, payroll  
  - **Supply Chain Management (SCM):** Inventory and order management  
  - **Human Resource Management (HRM):** Employee records, payroll  
  - **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Sales and customer interactions

#### **4. ERP System Demonstration (Optional or Video Presentation) (10 minutes)**  
- Show a demo video of an ERP like SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics.  
- Highlight how departments use ERP modules for finance, HR, and sales.

---

#### **5. Discussion and Q&A (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion Prompt:** What potential challenges would your organization face if implementing a new ERP?  
- **Q&A:** Encourage students to ask about ERP selection criteria, customization, and best practices.

### **Assessment Idea:**  
- **In-Class Activity:**  
  - Ask students to map the different functional modules of an ERP system for a fictional company (e.g., a mid-sized retail chain).  

- **Homework Assignment:**  
  - Write a short report on the advantages and potential risks of ERP adoption in a specific industry.
